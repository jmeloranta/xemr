a simple demonstration of angular momentum matrix processing.

First enter the number of spins and their L's.
The basis will be a product of mL states.


Then the following commands are available:

zero  = Zero spin Hamiltonian
print = Print spin Hamiltonian
diag  = Diagonalize spin Hamiltonian
expec = Calculate expectation value using current eigen vectors
int   = Calculate intensity matrix between states
add   = Add to given matrix element (for example to set first diagonal
        element to 1 use: add 0 0 1 0, where the first numbers give
        element indices and second and third real and imaginary parts)
exit  = Exit

Operators:

<multiplier> {x,y,z,+,-} <spin#> ({x,y,z} <spin#> ...)

For example:

1 z 1   (= 1.0 * Sz on spin #1)
1 z 1 y 2 (= 1.0 * (Sz on spin #1 + Sy on spin #2))

+ and - are rising / lowering operators.
