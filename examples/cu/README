Experimental and simulated EPR spectrum of Cu atoms in Kr matrix.
Cu atoms were generated by laser vaporization method. For description
of the method see K. Vaskonen, J. Eloranta, H. Kunttu, CPL submitted,
1999.

At X-band only two transitions / isotope are visible. The high field 
transition corresponds to electron spin transition and the low field
to nuclear spin transition. Note that the high field line defines the
g-value and the low field transition isotropic hyperfine coupling.
For further information on spectroscopic aspects see P. Kasai and
D. McLeod, Jr., JCP 55, 1566 (1971).
