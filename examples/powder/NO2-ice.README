Reproduction of Symons et al., JCS, 2873, 1962.

(a picture of the spectrum is also found in The Structure of Inorganic
Radicals by P. W. Atkins and M. C. R. Symons, 1967). Note that the
magnetic field increases from right to left.

In the corresponding xmgr graphics file the difference of numerical 
solution of spin hamiltonian vs. the usual 1st order approximation is shown.
Only electron spin was included in the transition moment operator.
