Reproduction of PO_3^2- radical as described by Morton et al.
in Mol. Phys. 4, 475, 1961.

The xmgr graphics file show the obtained powder spectra using
1st order simulation and the result obtained by numerical solution
of the spin hamiltonian. Note that the small peaks near 3100 and
3400 G are not real peaks. There is bug in the FFT lineshape routine 
and these are artifacts. This fixed by now... I should regenerate
this spectrum...
