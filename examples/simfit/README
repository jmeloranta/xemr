This directory contains a demonstration of simulation/fitting procedure
(Lorentzian line with a constant linewidth) as applied for hydroquinone cation
radical (cis & trans). The hydroqsuu150.sp? contains the experimental spectrum 
and the corresponding *.sps file the optimized simulation parameters. The
following restrictions were issued during the optimization:

lw(1) = lw(2)
hfc(1,1) = hfc(2,1)
pos(1) = pos(2)
amp(1) = amp(2)
+ other isotropic restrictions

The obtained simulation (overlaid with the experimental spectrum) is shown
in simfit.xmgr file.

Hydroqsuu250-hj.sps is the same with exception of Hooke-Jeeves optimization
method being employed.
