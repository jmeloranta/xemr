This directory contains example application of the Norris exchange
model as applied for the exchange problem of the hydroquinone cation
radical (four jump model). This is essentially a reproduction of the 
exchange simulation part of J. Eloranta et al., Magn. Reson. Chem. 36, 98
(1998). At specific temperature the simulated spectrum is fitted to
the experimental spectrum yielding the first order rate constants for
jump process. The activation energy for the rotation is then obtained
from the Arrhenius plot (arrhenius.xmgr). Note that this is a complete
reanalyzation of the EPR spectra which yields essentially the same
result as in the above Ref. 

Since the simulation fitting process contains a huge amount of parameters
(we have four spectra here!) the number of parameters must be reduced
in some way. Fortunately most of the parameters are the same and can
be delt with using the equivalency editor. The hyperfine couplings
were entered as (in Gauss; only approximate values are shown here):

Orientation 1 | Orientation 2 | Orientation 3 | Orientation 4	# of protons
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.46		3.46		3.46		3.46		2
2.00		2.40		2.50		2.13		1
2.00		2.13		2.50		2.40		1
2.50		2.13		2.00		2.40		1
2.50		2.40		2.00		2.13		1

Note that the order in which HFC:s are entered is critical because it
affects the order of the generated peaks. This is the same requirement
as in esrexn program by Heinzer. The exchange is performed
with the peaks which the same occurrence indices. Now we need to set
the following equivalences (spectrum index, hfc index):

hfc(1,1) = hfc(2,1) = hfc(3,1) = hfc(4,1)
hfc(1,2) = hfc(1,3) = hfc(3,4) = hfc(3,5)
hfc(1,4) = hfc(1,5) = hfc(3,2) = hfc(3,3)

hfc(2,2) = hfc(2,5) = hfc(4,3) = hfc(4,4)
hfc(2,3) = hfc(2,4) = hfc(4,2) = hfc(4,5)

and furthermore we can safly assume the following equivalences:

lw(1) = lw(2) = lw(3) = lw(4)
pos(1) = pos(2) = pos(3) = pos(4)

where lw denotes the linewidth and pos the g-value for the center
of the spectrum. This leaves the following variables for optimization:

hfc(1,1), hfc(1,2), hfc(1,4), hfc(2,2), hfc(2,3), lw(1), pos(1), and
the Norris exchange rate. All these required settings have been
issued in *.sps files in this directory.

Some general hints for this type of fitting:

- The "non-moving peaks" do not broaden which means that they can be used
  for obtaining the line width. Also the broadening should take place
  when the IHFC (in MHz) is of the same order as the exchange rate constant.
- Be careful that the correct intensity is obtained. The rate constant and
  intensity may have dependencies.
- Use mc_limit's wisely: begin with large mc_limits and the narrow to the
  smaller values.
- Finally include only intensity, linewidth and the rate constant in
  the optimization and repeat the mc_limit variation.
- Double check your variable and equivalence settings. Especially the
  equivalence settings get set incorrectly very easily.

The following scripts are also provided:

extract-rate.csh  - Extract rate constant and temperature data (X, Y pairs)
extract-error.csh - Extract simulation RMS error as a function of temperature
extract-oh.csh    - Extract hydroxyl group IHFC as a function of temperature

The file hyperfine.xmgr demonstrates the hydroxyl proton IHFC temperature
dependence as obtained in 270 K - 300 K region. This behaviour should be
linear in this region. The non-linear part may be obtained at low temperature
region (around 150 K).

NOTE: By the Norris method one obtains the *average rate constant* among
all different structures. This means that the rate constant obtained
in this example is really k_av = (4*k_1 + 2*k_2) / 6 where k_1 is the rate
constant for single OH-flip and k_2 for double OH-flip. Since the barrier
for double OH flip is approx. twice the single OH flip then we assume that
k_2 = 0 which means that k_av = 2*k_1 / 3. The extra 2/3 does not contribute
to the activation energy obtained by the Arrhenius plot. The constant
part only shows up when obtaining the activation entropy. The Heinzer method
can deal with this problem more easily where rate constants between each
structure may be obtained.
