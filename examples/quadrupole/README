Simulation of radical (gx = 2.0003, gy = 2.024, gz = 2.0215) with one
81Br nucleus with Ax = 100 G, Ay = -20 G, Az = -32 G, Px = -9.82 G, 
Py = -9.82, and Pz = 19.64 G.

The exact line positions for x, y, and z directions are given in
A. Lund and R. Erickson, Acta Chem. Scand. 52, 261 (1998).

Note that the couplings were given in Gauss and xemr does only very
crude conversion to MHz. Therefore the simulation is only qualitative
but essentially the same features are reproduced.
