Reproduction of Knight et al. (JCP v109, p. 1409, 1988).

In this work a strong mixing of triplet and singlet states of
atomic hydrogen pairs in rare gas matrices was observed and
simulated by using numerical solution of spin Hamiltonian.

knight.xmgr shows the low field area and knight2.xmgr the high field region.

NOTE: Currently there is a bug in xemr:

When two energy levels cross between the division points then the
transition moments are calculated between wrong levels. The only
way around this now is to tighten the divisioning...
