Example 1: D = +0.40 cm-1, g isotropic (= g_e), v = 9.3 GHz, 4^Sigma state.
           (Magnetic Atoms and Molecules, p. 245). Powder spectrum.

Example 2: D = +0.08 cm-1, g isotropic (= g_e), v = 9.3 GHz, 4^Sigma state.
           (Magnetic Atoms and Molecules, p. 244). Powder spectrum.

Example 3: D = +0.09 cm-1, g isotropic (= g_e), v = 9.3 GHz, 5^Sigma state.
	   (Magnetic Atoms and Molecules, p. 263). Powder spectrum.

Note that in example 2 there are many level crossings! I am not entirely
sure if the transition moments for absorptions at ca. 740 G are correct!
