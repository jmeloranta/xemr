Simulation of B2 radical (triplet Sigma) after L. B. Knight et al.
JACS 109, 3521 (1987).

The parameters (the case of argon and 11B) are:

g = 2.0015 (isotropic),
D = 3633 MHz,
A(parallel) = 11 MHz, A(perpendicular) = 27.4 MHz.

Because of axial symmetry the phi steps is set to 1 (in internal parameters).
This means that the g, A, etc. axis must be chosen suitably so that the
integration is performed in the right plane.

Note 1: Dzz = (2/3) D, Dxx = Dyy = -(1/3) D. This can be entred using
DEJ input (E = J = 0).

Note 2: This was simulated using fictious spin case which means that the
singlet level does not appear. This is just contrary to the hydrogen - 
hydrogen example.
