The calibration files are most easily generated by hand.

1. Signal phase calibration

- find suitable reference sample (for example strong pitch or perhaps
  something with even smaller linewidth)
- set large modulation to signal channel (say 10 gauss)
- adjust gain etc.
- find the resonance (1st derivative) maximum
- adjust phase (using oscilloscope) to the signal maximum
- record the phase setting. This corresponds to 0 degree
  in measurement->setup spectrometer.
- Find signal minimum in similar fashion; This corresponds to 90 degree
  setting.

2. Modulation amplitude calibration

- Set desired modulation freq.
- set large modulation amplitude (as large as possible)
- record spectrum (with 0 degree phase)
- measure the peak to peak separation of the over modulated signal;
  this separation is the maximum modulation that can be generated
  in the cavity. This is the max modulation value in
  measurement->setup spectrometer.


Repeat the above for all desired modulation frequencies.
After this is done then remember to save the settings in
measurement->setup spectrometer (as root because calibration
file directory is only writable by root).

NOTE: xemr does not lock the modulation and phase scales in the
signal channel but rather does everything by itself.
