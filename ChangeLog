Tue Sep 22 18:15:52 EEST 1998
- Fixed a bug in ER200D endor interface. The documentation on attenuator

- Fixed PO23+ example (FFT linshape bug removed)

Sun Oct  4 13:45:14 EEST 1998

  the previous FFT routines. Also the power of two requirement is gone.
- Spectrum differentation now works in Fourier space when generating
  derivative spectra
- Switched to linux-gpib-2.04 which supports variety of gpib cards.
  The driver appears to much better than the one I used previously!

Mon Oct  5 10:21:39 EEST 1998

  enhanced to 64 K.

  and one example using it.

- Added cross/auto correlation 

Thu Jan  14 10:45:14 EET 1999

- Windowing in Fourier space
- Cu atom example + BR graphs

Thu Jan  21 19:20:03 EET 1999

- Fourier space axis is now correct (for left/real part only).

Sun Feb 14 21:20:56 EET 1999
- Added more windowin functions
- there are still numerical stability problems with cepstral analysis.

  The number of spectral points appears to give better results.

Tue Feb 16 20:16:14 EET 1999
- changes to windowing functions
- fixed signal phase correction (given in degrees - cos works in radians)

Thu Feb 18 18:08:49 EET 1999
- Major speed up for er200d endor scanning.
  (affects other systems to small extent as well)

Fri Feb 19 18:08:04 EET 1999
- Changes to varian measurement setup (the intensity is now read directly
  from behind the signal channel - should have done this in the first place...)
- The internal gain register in varian (DAS8) can now be adjusted
  from the program.
- Corrected typos in varian interfacing documentation

Tue Feb 23 21:43:41 EET 1999

Fri Feb 26 09:09:46 EET 1999
- added ang. mom. related stuff (B.L, aS.L and oct/tetr crystal fields 
  + distortions)
- ang. mom. is now calculated instead of using arrays
- L+ and L- operators added (and I identity)
- fixed a bug in numerical SH: if the same spin was operated twice with
  an operator that changed the spin state then this was not accounted for!
  (this error produced incorrect results, for example for: I.P.I and S.D.S
  systems)
- added so, cra, and crb to variables
- load/save now keeps the selected directory

Sat Feb 27 12:35:14 EET 1999
- some of the baseline stuff rewritten
- INDEX macro was just the opposite as it should have been
  (it now gives the correct array ordering required by fortran convention)
  This may reverse indexing for simulation sets saved before this.
  (for example, g_ij will now be g_ji... - fortunately these are
  mostly symmetric). This appears to cure the Heinzer exchange simulation
  routines.
- Oh well. The numerical SH matrix construction was somewhat rewritten.
  Maybe I got it right this time ;-)

Mon Mar  1 11:22:47 EET 1999
- spin-orbit and crystal field params are now in cm-1.

  two for "the Knight example").
- fixed FFT xbeg and xend
- esp2epr converter had some inconsistencies...

Tue Mar  2 17:38:37 EET 1999
- Active space definition: one can now tell which energy levels are considered
  when calculating the spectrum. However, the eigen solver still produces
  all the levels - they are just excluded from the transition search.

Wed Mar  3 08:27:24 EET 1999
- preloader for powder / numerical spin hamilton simulations (speed up)
- for tetragonal distortion one can now specify x, y and z
  distortions separately

  now. The crystal field stuff becomes very tiresom to program...

  on an empty page

Fri Mar  5 09:30:42 EET 1999
- documentation updates on numer. spin hamiltonian
- new example: quenched boron atom
- everything can now also be specified in cm-1

Sun Mar  7 22:21:01 EET 1999
- a factor of half speed up for numer. spin Hamiltonian simulation
- variables dialog is now smaller

Thu Mar 18 18:34:13 EET 1999
- Added Boltzmann populations for energy levels which affect the
  transition intensities.

Tue Mar 23 10:10:31 EET 1999
- Large arrays are now allocated only when needed in hamilton.c
  (via malloc()). This solves start up problems on small memory machines
  (ie. core dumping when xemr was started)

Thu Mar 25 09:13:49 EET 1999
- Better support for axial symmetry powder spectra
  (nphi = 1)

  sometimes set to incorrect values.

Tue Apr 20 10:13:46 EEST 1999
- fixed a bug in preloader - transition moment operator cannot be preloaded!
- fixes to ENDOR simulation (numer. spin hamiltoninan)
- integration intervals can now be specified
- clean up powder integrator

Sat Apr 24 21:21:37 EEST 1999
- Fixed naphthoquinone endor simulation example - the difference in line
  intensities was due to a bug...
- minor changes to powder integrator

Wed May 19 17:19:02 EEST 1999
- Switched to portland c-compiler: b2 triplet is now at 39 s ;-)
  (the code still compiles with gcc - see the main makefile)

Sat Jun  5 10:41:33 EEST 1999
- Obtained portland group patch for redhat 6.0 - things appear to work now!

Sat Jun 12 07:28:56 EEST 1999
- One can now visualize: transition moments or transition eigen vector
  difference (ie. to characterize the transition). It calculates the
  differences between squares of basis coefficients between given two
  states.
- Added "measurement in progress..." indicator
- minor cleanups for xemr/main.c
- changed the function of arrows: up & down = scale, left & right = page
  prev & next
- fixed parameter setup problem (dlevel & co. were only updated after
  define simulation dialog)
- fitting can now also be performed in the freq. space (not tested)
- Implemented Hooke-Jeeves optimization method


Thu Jun 17 22:55:16 EEST 1999
- Removed % stuff from mc_limit - it was rather unpractical!
  The mc_limit is now given in difference value.
- minor speed up to numer SH in misc.c (preload).
- more speed up for transition moment calculations:
  The b2 (1500 G) example went from 30 s -> 13 s!
  For some ENDOR simulations the run time dropped also to one third.

Sun Jun 20 16:29:37 EEST 1999
- Changed the input scheme for g, A, D, and P tensors. THe user should
  now input tensor principal values, and the rotation matrix that 
  provides the relation between the fixed axis system.
  NOTE: the aliases still use the old notation!
- fixed powder integrator bug when regular mesh was used.
- added a check for illegal angle values
  
Thu Jun 24 22:02:33 EEST 1999
- rewriting of powder integration routines. Many different integration
  algorithms were added.
- the powder integrator params are now saved to sps files.
- Added manual RMS spectrum evaluation for spectra on two different pages.
- Transition to comedi library started (both das8 and 1600 are now supported).

Mon Jun 28 20:50:31 EEST 1999
- Added linear and cubic spline transition interpolation (transition position
  and transition moment). This is similar that sophe uses (except that
  it does cubic spline and linear interpolation at the same time)

Thu Jul  1 17:59:45 EEST 1999
- Implemented eiven vector following ("level follow"): The eigen ordering 
  problems should be gone now. However if the spectral range is large then the
  eigenvectors may have weak correlations to the starting states ->
  orders may be incorrect.
- Added peak "padding" in hamilton.c: it now returns the same number of
  peaks so that the peak positions in peak arrays stays at the same place.
- BR-gaph now respects level follow. Watch out for this when doing
  trmom or transition analysis (these do not respect level following!)

Sun Jul  4 12:04:08 EEST 1999
- the level following works now better. The previous point is used in
  calculating the correlation matrix.

Fri Oct  1 08:37:34 EEST 1999
- fixed PEEK_ORDER_HACK bug which sometimes missed peaks.
- fixed a bug in crystal field code - it was sometimes operating on
  wrong spin!!!
- more changes to orbital angular momentum: now it can handle many
  electrons (the same spin-own-orbit constant for all electrons - 
  although this can be generalized easily so that each electron
  could have its' own spin-own-orbit constant).
- removed value fields in variable dialog: one could accidentally
  change the values with this!
- equivalence editor now displays the index texts "on the fly"

Fri Oct  9 08:37:34 EEST 1999
- fixes to variables and equivalences dialogs
- updated device drivers to kernel 2.2

Tue Oct 12 20:14:56 EEST 1999

  ignored!)
- crystal field document updates

Tue Oct 22 20:14:56 EEST 1999
- linear interp. powder integrator typo fix
- minor clean ups in hamilton.c and powder.c
- libf2c is no longer needed if portland cc is used (argh... arpack needed it)

  was sometimes wrong.
- adding empty page as overlay caused core dump
- added cnvall script which converts all ESP type spectra to xemr format
  present in the current directory

Sat Oct 30 10:29:34 EEST 1999
